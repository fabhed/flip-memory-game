To implement this, we will need the following files:

1. `server.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It will set up a Node.js server that serves our HTML5 game.

2. `package.json`: This file will contain the metadata of our project, including the dependencies.

3. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will be served by our Node.js server. It will contain the structure of our memory game.

4. `styles.css`: This file will contain all the CSS styles for our memory game.

5. `script.js`: This file will contain all the JavaScript logic for our memory game.

Let's start with the `server.js` file:
